This webapp has been created following [this workshop](https://github.com/rust-basel/fullstack-rust-workshop).
It's a demo app that runs locally and lets you create lists.

To run, you need:

* rust nightly compiler
* dioxus cli
* npm
* cargo make

Then, a `cargo make --no-workspace dev` should run the app.

Read see the linked workshop repo for more information.
